Logic Mapper for Truth Tables in JuPyter Notebooks

## Overview

The purpose of this library is to Create, Edit, and Display Truth Tables of any size. 

It is able to be used seemlessly inside jupyter notebooks.

I wrote this software because I was searching for something that would simplify the process of creating truth tables, but I was unable to find anything that did the job how I wanted it to do it. In the end I wrote this to streamline the entire process down to a few lines of code.

## Development Environment

I programmed the entire thing inside of VS Code using Python 3.11.9. I also had the Gemini Code Assist extension enabling faster production. I also will be installing and using the following libraries: setuptools, wheel, twine, and multiprocess.
